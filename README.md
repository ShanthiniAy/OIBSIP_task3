# Car Price Prediction

This Python code demonstrates how to predict car prices using a machine learning model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions for new data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `car_price_prediction.py` file.

2. Place your car data in a CSV file named `car_data.csv` in the same directory as the code. The CSV file should contain columns: `Car_Name`, `Year`, `Selling_Price`, `Present_Price`, `Driven_kms`, `Fuel_Type`, `Selling_type`, `Transmission`, `Owner`.

3. Run the `car_price_prediction.py` script.

```bash
python car_price_prediction.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide input data for car price prediction.

## Code Structure

- `car_price_prediction.py`: The main script for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `car_data.csv`: Sample dataset containing car information.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset from `car_data.csv`.

2. Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression) and train the model.

5. Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

6. Make predictions for new car data.
